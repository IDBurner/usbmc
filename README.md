=====
This is VitaShell's patches for USB storage support as a standalone plugin. If 
loaded on startup (before SceShell), it will automatically mount the USB 
storage as `ux0` instead of the memory card or internal memory.

To install, copy the plugin to `ur0:tai/usbmc.skprx` and add that path to the 
taiHEN `ur0:tai/config.txt` under `*KERNEL`. If you have a memory card inserted 
or you have a Vita with internal memory (LCD and PSTV), you must delete 
`ux0:tai/config.txt` from the original memory and use `ur0:tai/config.txt` from 
now on. This is because taiHEN loads before the memory card redirection patches 
and will attempt to read config.txt from there first.

Full credits to The_FloW for these patches.

## Memory Card Priority

1. Vita memory card will be used if inserted.
2. USB storage will be used if inserted and formatted correctly.
3. Internal memory will be used if it exists (PSTV and PCH-2000).
